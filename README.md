# Control Hub Login Mock

A simple Node/Express project that recreates the Control Hub login screen shown in the provided design reference. The UI uses only static HTML and CSS and can be served locally with Node.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the page.

## Notes
- The layout is responsive and keeps the hero imagery with a floating phone card on smaller screens.
- Imagery comes from Unsplash placeholders; replace them with production assets as needed.
